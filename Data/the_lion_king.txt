The sun shines down on Pride Rock, with the animals watching as Simba is presented from atop Pride Rock. The title card appears, then fades. A mouse scurries across the floor of a cave, sniffs the air, and washes its face. For a moment, it sits peacefully. Then it rears onto its hind legs, smelling the air, and a giant clawed paw crushes it. Slowly, the paw draws the struggling, squealing mouse into the air to reveal Scar.
Scar	Life's not fair, is it? You see, I... Well, I shall never be king. Huh. [Scar lets the mouse scurry across his paw.] And you... [The mouse tries to jump to freedom, but Scar snags it in his claws again.] shall never see the light of another day. Hmm, hmm. Adieu.
Scar opens his jaws and lowers the mouse into his mouth.
Zazu	Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
The mouse struggles to wriggle out from under Scar's paw, to no avail.
Scar	What do you want?
Zazu	I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way, [Zazu bows over one wing.] so you'd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning.
With Scar distracted, the mouse wriggles out of his grasp and escapes into a nearby hole in the wall.
Scar	Oh, now, look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.
Zazu	Ha! You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
Zazu crosses his wings huffily.
Scar	Oooh, I quiver with fear!
Scar crouches and bares his teeth at Zazu, who backs away fearfully.
Zazu	Now, Scar, don't look at me that way. Help!
Zazu tries to fly away, but Scar catches him in his jaws. Mufasa's paw steps into view behind Scar.
Mufasa	Scar?
Scar looks at Mufasa over his shoulder, his cheeks puffed out.
Scar	Mm-hmm?
Mufasa	Drop him.
Zazu's beak pokes out of Scar's mouth.
Zazu	Impeccable timing, Your Majesty. [Scar spits out Zazu, who sits up with saliva-plastered wings.] Ugh.
Scar	Why, if it isn't my big brother [Scar saunters toward Mufasa.] descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
Scar turns and saunters away.
Mufasa	Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
Scar	That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful! [Scar drags his claws along the wall, creating a screeching sound that makes Zazu cringe.] Must've slipped my mind.
Zazu	Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, [Zazu flies accusingly into Scar's face.] as the king's brother, you should've been first in line!
Scar snaps his jaws shut, causing Zazu to take refuge behind Mufasa's leg.
Scar	Well, I was first in line... [Zazu peeks out at Scar, indignant.] until the little hairball was born.
Scar thrusts his face toward Zazu, who ducks back behind Mufasa's leg. Mufasa lowers his head to Scar's level.
Mufasa	That hairball is my son [Mufasa and Scar lift their heads simultaneously.] and your future king.
Scar	Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.
Scar turns and walks away.
Mufasa	Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Scar looks over his shoulder at Mufasa.
Scar	Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Once more, Scar turns and walks away. Mufasa launches himself after Scar.
Mufasa	*roars* [Mufasa blocks Scar's way and advances threateningly.] Is that a challenge?!
Scar	Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream [Scar rolls his eyes.] of challenging you.
Zazu emerges from under Mufasa.
Zazu	Pity. Why not?
Zazu puts his wings on his hips. Scar ducks his head to address Zazu.
Scar	Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share, but when it comes to brute strength... [Scar lifts his head to address Mufasa, clearly bitter and incensed. After a moment, the expression fades, and he shoulders past Mufasa, who glares at him. Scar looks back at Mufasa and Zazu.] I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
Scar walks off into the savanna.
Zazu	*sighs* There's one in every family, sire. Two in mine, actually. [Zazu flies up to perch on Mufasa's shoulder.] And they always manage to ruin special occasions.
Mufasa	What am I going to do with him?
Zazu grins cheekly.
Zazu	He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Mufasa grins back.
Mufasa	Zazu!
Zazu	And just think, [Zazu flies ahead of Mufasa, who walks after him.] whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him!
Mufasa	*chuckles*
The scene fades. Clouds roil over the savanna. Thunder rumbles, and curtains of rain fall in the distance. The smooth surface of a river is disrupted by heavy rainfall. Thunder booms, and lightning zigzags across the sky, illuminating Rafiki's lone baobab tree. Inside, Rafiki uses a gourd to paint a lion cub, with lightning occasionally lighting up his canvas.
Rafiki	*mutters* Ah. [Rafiki sets down one gourd and picks up another.] Hmm. [Rafiki smiles at his handiwork.] *laughs* [Rafiki dips his thumb in the paint and smears it across the painted cub's forehead.] Simba. *chuckles*
The screen grows dark around the painting of Simba before it disappears completely. The scene transitions to an early dawn at Pride Rock. Simba, now a cub, emerges on the promontory, his tail raised. With an excited look, he races away. Simba races into the den, where the pride is sleeping.
Simba	Dad! Dad! Come on, Dad. We gotta go. Wake up!
Simba dodges around the lionesses, jostling them.
Lioness	Oof!
Simba	Sorry!
Mufasa	*snores*
Simba jumps up on Mufasa, who is sound asleep.
Simba	Dad! [Simba's expression turns dour when Mufasa does not respond.] Dad.
Sarabi	Your son is awake.
Simba	[in the background] Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.
Mufasa	Before sunrise, he's your son.
Simba	Dad! Come on, Dad. [Simba tugs Mufasa's ear, but loses his grip and tumbles out of view.] Whoa! [Simba headbutts Mufasa's face, and Mufasa sleepily opens one eye.] You promised!
Simba glares at Mufasa.
Mufasa	Okay, okay. I'm up, I'm up.
Simba	Yeah!
Simba races away excitedly.
Mufasa	*yawns*
Simba skips out of the den, with Mufasa and Sarabi emerging shortly afterward. Simba bounces up to Sarabi and rubs against her leg affectionately. Sarabi gives his rump an encouraging nudge and watches, smiling, as Mufasa and Simba begin to ascend Pride Rock. The next shot shows the top of Pride Rock illuminated by the rising sun, with Mufasa and Simba sitting side-by-side atop the summit.
Mufasa	Look, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
Simba	Wow.
Mufasa	A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you [Mufasa ducks down to Simba's level.] as the new king.
Simba	And this'll all be mine?
Mufasa	Everything.
Simba strides along the edge of Pride Rock, overlooking the Pride Lands.
Simba	Everything the light touches. [Simba sits.] What about that shadowy place?
Simba looks back at Mufasa questioningly. Mufasa strides toward Simba sternly.
Mufasa	That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.
Simba	But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
Mufasa smiles.
Mufasa	Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time.
Mufasa strides away. Simba follows Mufasa, grinning.
Simba	There's more?
Mufasa	*laughs* Simba...
The scene transitions. Gazelles prance across the savanna. Nearby, Mufasa and Simba stride side-by-side, with Pride Rock in the distance.
Mufasa	Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
Simba	But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Mufasa ducks down to Simba's level.
Mufasa	Yes, Simba, but let me explain. [Mufasa lifts his head.] When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so [Mufasa ducks down to Simba's level.] we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.
Mufasa gestures with his head to a river, where gazelles cavort and giraffes graze from trees. Zazu swoops in from overhead.
Zazu	Good morning, sire!
Mufasa	Good morning, Zazu.
Zazu lands on a nearby boulder.
Zazu	Checking in with the morning report!
Zazu bows.
Mufasa	Fire away.
Zazu	Well! [Zazu speaks with one wing shielding his beak, as if to spread gossip.] The buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
A grasshopper jumps past Simba, who takes chase.
Mufasa	Oh, really?
Zazu	And the baboons are going ape over this. [Simba continues to hunt the grasshopper, and Mufasa takes notice.] Of course, the giraffes are acting like they're above it all...
Mufasa	What are you doing, son?
Simba attempts to catch the grasshopper on a rock, but opens his paws to emptiness.
Simba	Pouncing.
Mufasa ducks down conspiratorially.
Mufasa	Let an old pro show you how it's done.
Zazu	The tickbirds are pecking on the elephants. I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't...
Zazu shrugs dramatically.
Mufasa	Zazu, would you turn around?
Zazu	Yes, sire. [Zazu turns around.] The cheetahs are hard up, but I always say...
Mufasa uses a paw to lower Simba's rump.
Mufasa	Stay low to the ground.
Zazu waves a wing emphatically.
Zazu	Cheetahs never prosper...
Simba	Yeah, okay. [Zazu glances quizzically at Mufasa and Simba over his shoulder.] Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
Zazu	What's going on?
Mufasa	Pouncing lesson.
Zazu	Oh, very good. Pouncing. [Zazu turns away, apparently satisfied. Suddenly, he spasms.] Pouncing?! [Zazu turns back to face Mufasa.] Oh, no, sire, you can't be serious... [Mufasa gestures with one paw for Zazu to turn around.] Oh... [Zazu reluctantly turns around.] This is so humiliating.
Mufasa	Try not to make a sound.
Zazu glances over his shoulder.
Zazu	What are you telling him, Mufasa? [Zazu looks behind him to find that Mufasa and Simba have seemingly disappeared.] Mufasa? [Zazu tenses his body.] Simba? [Simba pounces on Zazu.] *squawks*
Mufasa	*laughs* [Simba glances over his shoulder at Mufasa, grinning, before he strides away. Meanwhile, Zazu lies on his back in the dirt. Simba returns to Mufasa.] That's very good! *laughs*
The mole pops out of a hole in the dirt right beneath Zazu's head.
Mole	Zazu!
Zazu	Yes!
The mole salutes Zazu.
Mole	Sir! News from the underground.
Mufasa wraps a paw around Simba.
Mufasa	Now, this time–
Zazu	Sire! [Zazu's head emerges from behind a rock, his eyes wide and terrified.] Hyenas! In the Pride Lands!
Mufasa starts to bound away, but pauses to look at Zazu.
Mufasa	Zazu, take Simba home.
Simba strides after Mufasa.
Simba	Awww, Dad, can't I come?
Mufasa shakes his head.
Mufasa	No, son.
Mufasa runs off into the savanna. Simba stalks off with his head low.
Simba	Pah! I never get to go anywhere.
Zazu	Oh, young master, one day, you will be king. [Zazu gestures with a wing. He takes to the air and flies over Simba, who is heading toward Pride Rock.] Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
The scene transitions. Scar prowls along a rock ledge. He pauses, then agitatedly knocks a bone off the edge. As Scar continues to slink along, Simba bounds into view.
Simba	Hey, Uncle Scar, guess what?
Scar pauses. He turns and glowers at Simba.
Scar	I despise guessing games.
Simba approaches Scar and strikes a pose.
Simba	I'm going to be king of Pride Rock.
Simba bounds away as Scar scowls.
Scar	Oh, goodie.
Simba walks to the ledge and overlooks the savanna.
Simba	My dad just showed me the whole kingdom. [Simba looks at Scar over his shoulder.] And I'm gonna rule it all! *cackles*
Scar glares at Simba, his back hunched.
Scar	Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know.
Scar flops onto his side. Simba approaches Scar and jumps up on his mane.
Simba	Hey, Uncle Scar. When I'm king, what'll that make you?
Scar	A monkey's uncle.
Simba tumbles off Scar.
Simba	*laughs* You're so weird.
Scar lifts his head to meet Simba's gaze.
Scar	You have no idea. [Scar stands up and walks away.] So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
Simba trails after Scar.
Simba	Everything.
Scar	He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border.
Scar sits. Simba sits also, his ears drooping.
Simba	Well, no. He said I can't go there.
Scar	And he's absolutely right! It's far [Scar leans in dramatically.] too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there.
Scar looks away. Simba stands and puffs out his chest.
Simba	Well, I'm brave! [Simba tilts his head questioningly.] What's out there?
Scar	No, I'm sorry, Simba. [Scar looks away.] I just can't tell you.
Simba moves in front of Scar.
Simba	Why not?
Scar	Simba, Simba, [Simba sits.] I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favorite nephew.
Scar pats Simba's head with a comparatively giant paw.
Simba	*snorts* Yeah, right. I'm your only nephew.
Simba peeks out from under Scar's paw.
Scar	All the more reason for me to be protective. [Scar lifts a claw like it's his pinky.] An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. [Simba stands up excitedly, and Scar slaps a paw to his mouth in mock horror.] Oops!
Simba	An elephant what? [Simba looks away.] Whoa...
Scar puts a paw to his head, feigning dismay.
Scar	Oh, dear, I've said too much. Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all. [Simba tries to slink off, but Scar grabs him and pulls him close.] Oh, just do me one favor: promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
Simba	No problem.
Scar	There's a good lad. [Scar nudges Simba away.] You run along now and have fun. And remember... [Simba pauses and looks back at Scar.] it's our little secret.
Simba runs off, and Scar walks away, smiling deviously. The scene transitions. Lionesses sun themselves on rocks as Simba races by. He stops on a ledge where Sarabi is sleeping. Across from her, Sarafina bathes Nala.
Simba	Hey, Nala.
Nala	Hi, Simba.
Simba	[whispering, with one paw shielding his mouth] Come on, I just heard about this great place.
Nala	Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
Simba glowers.
Sarabi	And it's time for yours.
Simba tries to escape, but Sarabi snatches him up in her jaws, deposits him in her lap, and starts licking him. Simba struggles to get away.
Simba	Mom! Mom, you're messing up my mane. [Sarabi licks Simba's forehead, giving him a cowlick. She smiles down at him affectionately. Simba jumps out of her lap and smoothes down the cowlick.] Okay, okay. I'm clean. Can we go now?
Nala lies on her back while Sarafina bathes her rump and sides.
Nala	So, where are we going? It better not be any place dumb.
Simba approaches.
Simba	No. It's really cool.
Sarabi	So, where is this "really cool" place?
Simba flinches.
Simba	Oh. [Simba turns around and smiles brightly.] Uh...around the water hole.
Nala	The water hole?! What's so great about the water hole?
Simba smiles innocently at his mother before turning on Nala.
Simba	[in an aside to Nala] I'll show you when we get there.
Nala	Oh. Uh, Mom? [Nala sits up.] Can I go with Simba?
Sarafina	Hmm. What do you think, Sarabi?
Sarabi	Well...
Simba and Nala walk up to Sarabi, grinning exaggeratedly.
Simba and Nala	Please?
Sarabi	It's all right with me.
Simba and Nala bound away excitedly.
Simba	Yeah!
Nala	All right!
Sarabi	As long as Zazu goes with you.
Simba and Nala pull up short in dismay.
Simba	No, not Zazu!
The scene transitions. Simba and Nala follow a dirt trail to the water hole, with Zazu flying overhead.
Zazu	Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
Nala	[whispering] So, where are we really going?
Simba	[whispering] An elephant graveyard.
Nala	Wow!
Simba	[whispering] Shh! Zazu.
Nala	[whispering] Right. So, how are we gonna ditch the dodo?
Simba	[whispering] Oh, I know how we can...
Zazu notices the cubs talking in low voices. He swoops down to join them.
Zazu	Oh, just look at you two. Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna. [Simba and Nala exchange bored looks. Zazu bows.] Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all.
Simba tilts his head.
Simba	Be-what?
Zazu	Betrothed. Intended. Affianced.
Simba and Nala exchange confused looks. Nala leans forward.
Nala	Meaning?
Zazu	One day, you two are going to be married!
Zazu grabs his sides like he's holding on to his coat lapels. Simba sticks out his tongue.
Simba	Yuck!
Nala	Ewww!
Simba ducks down to Zazu's level. Zazu crosses his wings huffily.
Simba	I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Nala ducks down on Zazu's other side.
Nala	Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Zazu	Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. [Zazu walks off, gesturing dramatically. Simba mouths, "blah, blah, blah," behind Zazu's back.] It's a tradition going back generations.
Simba	Well, when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
Simba winks at Nala.
Zazu	Not so long as I'm around.
Simba strides up to Zazu.
Simba	Well, in that case, you're fired.
Zazu	Hmm. Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Zazu pokes Simba's nose. Nala strides up to join Simba.
Nala	Well, he's the future king.
Simba	Yeah. So you have to do what I tell you.
Simba thumps Zazu's chest. Zazu puts his wings on his hips.
Zazu	Not yet, I don't. And with an attitude like that, [Simba gestures flippantly. Simba and Nala walk away.] I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed.
Simba looks over his shoulder at Zazu.

A nearby geyser erupts.
Simba and Nala	*gasp*
As the steam clears, Simba and Nala notice a nearby ridge, over which an elephant skull is barely visible. Simba pads closer, a grin spreading across his face. Together, the cubs climb the ridge to view the skull.
Simba	This is it. We made it.
Simba and Nala jump up on one of the skull's tusks and overlook the Elephant Graveyard. They exchange awed looks.
Simba and Nala	Whoa!
Nala	It's really creepy.
Simba	Yeah. Isn't it great?
Nala	We could get in big trouble.

Simba	There's only one way to know. Come on. [Simba walks toward the skull.] Let's go check it out.
Zazu flits in front of Simba, blocking his path.
Zazu	Wrong! [Zazu shoos Simba away from the skull.] The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.
Simba reluctantly walks away.
Simba	Awww, man!
Zazu wrings his wings nervously.
Zazu	We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
Simba ducks down to Zazu's level.
Simba	Look! Banana Beak is scared. *snickers*
Zazu pokes Simba's nose with a feather, as if it's a finger.
Zazu	It's Mister Banana Beak to you, fuzzy. And right now, we are all in very real danger.
Zazu looks around nervously while Simba strides past him.
Simba	Danger? Ha! I walk on the wild side. [Simba pauses in front of the skull, crouching low.] I laugh in the face of danger. [Simba rears back his head dramatically.] Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	[from inside the skull] *laugh*
Simba's expression turns to horror. He races away from the skull and hides behind Nala and Zazu. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed emerge from within the elephant skull and prowl toward Simba and Nala, whom Zazu shields with his wings.
Shenzi	Well, well, well, Banzai. What have we got here?
Banzai	Hmm. I don't know, Shenzi. Uh, what do you think, Ed?
Banzai looks back at Ed.
Ed	*laughs maniacally*
Banzai	Yeah, just what I was thinking... A trio of trespassers!
Banzai juts his head accusingly at Zazu, who continues to shield Simba and Nala with his wings. Zazu clasps his wings like they're hands.
Zazu	And quite by accident, let me assure you. [Simba and Nala start to slink off.] A simple navigational error.
Zazu tries to follow Simba and Nala, but Shenzi steps on his tail, halting him.
Shenzi	Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. I know you. You're Mufasa's little stooge!
Shenzi ducks down to Zazu's level. Zazu pulls his tail out from under Shenzi's paw.
Zazu	I, madam, am the king's majordomo.
Banzai and Ed circle Simba and Nala.
Banzai	And that would make you...?
Simba	The future king!
Shenzi joins Banzai and Ed in circling Simba and Nala.
Shenzi	Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?
Simba	Puh! You can't do anything to me.
Zazu	Uh, technically, they can. [Zazu steeples his wings like they're fingers.] We are on their land.
Simba	But, Zazu, you told me they're nothing but slobbering, [Zazu desperately signals Simba to stop.] mangy, stupid poachers.
Zazu nervously clasps his wings like they're hands.
Zazu	Ix-nay on the upid-stay...
Banzai juts his head accusingly at Zazu.
Banzai	Who are you callin' "upid-stay"?!
Zazu	My, my, my! [Simba, Nala, and Zazu try to run away.] Oh, look at the sun! It's time to go!
Shenzi cuts off Simba, Nala, and Zazu.
Shenzi	What's the hurry? We'd love [Shenzi advances on Simba, Nala, and Zazu, causing them to back away. Zazu shields the cubs with his wings.] you to stick around for dinner.
Banzai	Yeah, we could have whatever's "lion" around! *laughs* [in the background] Get it? Lion around? *laughs*
Shenzi	Wait, wait, wait! [Shenzi wags a paw at Banzai.] I got one! I got one! Make mine a "cub" sandwich. Whatcha think? *laughs*
Ed gestures wildly.
Ed	*jabbers incoherently*
Shenzi	What, Ed? What is it?
Banzai looks in the direction Ed is pointing.
Banzai	Hey, did we order this dinner to-go?
Shenzi	No. Why?
Banzai	'Cause there it goes!
Simba and Nala race away, with Zazu flying overhead.
Simba and Nala	*pant*
As he flies, Zazu is caught by his tail and yanked backward.
Zazu	*squawks*
Simba and Nala	*pant*
Simba and Nala pause in the middle of the Elephant Graveyard.
Nala	Did we lose 'em?
Simba	I think so. [Simba looks around.] Where's Zazu?
Zazu struggles as Banzai jerks him around by his wings. Ed and Shenzi watch gleefully.
Zazu	Aah!
Banzai	The little majordomo bird hippety-hopped all the way to the birdie boiler.
Banzai shoves Zazu into a geyser.
Zazu	Oh, no! Not the birdie boiler! [The geyser explodes, sending Zazu shooting into the air like a rocket.] Aah!
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*laugh*
Simba	[from offscreen] Hey! [Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed stop laughing and look up to where Simba is standing on the ridge above them.] Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Shenzi	Like you?
Simba	Oops.
Simba and Nala run away. Shenzi nips at Nala's hindquarters.
Nala	*screams*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed emerge through the steam, blocking Simba and Nala's path.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	Boo!
Simba and Nala skid to a halt.
Simba and Nala	*gasp*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*laugh*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed bite threateningly at Simba and Nala. They run away, with the hyenas in hot pursuit. The cubs climb an elephant skull, and Banzai leaps after them, taking a snap at their hindquarters.
Nala	*shrieks*
Simba and Nala slide down an elephant spine. They shoot off the end and land on a hill of bones.
Simba and Nala	*scream*
Simba and Nala begin to climb hastily as the hyenas close in from below.
Nala	[from offscreen] Simba!
Simba pauses at the top of the hill and looks back in horror.
Simba	*gasps*
Nala slides down the hill toward the hyenas.
Nala	*screams*
Simba races back down the hill and scratches Shenzi's cheek right as she is about to bite Nala.
Shenzi	*snarls*
Simba and Nala race into a high-walled section of the Elephant Graveyard. They clamber up an elephant skeleton and paw desperately at the high wall, only for the rotting skin to break under them and send them tumbling to the ground. They clamber back to their paws, backing away in terror.
Simba and Nala	*gasp*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed close in.
Banzai	Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Simba stands protectively in front of a cowering Nala.
Simba	*roars weakly*
Shenzi	That was it? *laughs* Do it again. Come on.
Simba roars again, seemingly with a full-grown lion's roar.
Mufasa	[from offscreen] *roars*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed pause.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	Huh?
Mufasa swats Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed aside.
Mufasa	*roars*
Mufasa attacks Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Simba and Nala watch in terror while Zazu lands next to them. Mufasa pins the hyenas to the ground.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
Shenzi	Oh, please, please! Uncle! Uncle!
Banzai	Ow, ow, ow!
Mufasa	Silence!
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed flinch.
Banzai	Oh, come on, we're gonna shut up right now!
Shenzi	Calm down. We're really sorry.
Mufasa	If you ever come near my son again...
Shenzi	Oh, this is...this is your son?
Banzai	Oh, yours!
Banzai points at Mufasa, then rubs his head with one paw, as if in mock realization.
Shenzi	Did you know that?
Banzai	No! Me? [Banzai gestures to himself with one paw.] I didn't know. No! Did you?
Shenzi	No, of course not!
Banzai	No.
Shenzi and Banzai	Ed?
Shenzi and Banzai look at Ed.
Ed	*nods*
Mufasa	*roars*
Shenzi and Ed hug one another in fear.
Banzai	Heh, heh. Toodles!
Banzai waves at Mufasa. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed flee the scene.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
Zazu lands next to Mufasa and nods satisfactorily. Mufasa turns and glares at him, causing him to flinch back. Simba and Nala approach tentatively from behind.
Simba	Dad, I...
Mufasa looks sternly over one shoulder.
Mufasa	You deliberately disobeyed me.
Simba looks crestfallen.
Simba	Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
Mufasa	[harshly] Let's go home.
Mufasa walks off. Zazu flies after him, casting a sad look at Simba and Nala. Simba and Nala trail after Mufasa.
Nala	I thought you were very brave.
Simba looks away sadly. Overhead, Scar watches the party leave with a furious look on his face. The scene transitions to evening. Mufasa stalks across the savanna, with Simba and Nala trailing behind him and Zazu flying overhead. Nala peers uncertainly at Simba, who keeps his head down. Zazu watches the cubs from overhead.
Mufasa	Zazu!
Zazu flinches and hurriedly lands in front of Mufasa. He folds his wings nervously.
Zazu	Yes, sire?
Mufasa	Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Mufasa glares over one shoulder at Simba. Simba ducks low in the grass, with Nala watching in concern. Zazu flies over to Simba and Nala, and alights in-between them.
Zazu	Come, Nala. Simba? [Zazu puts his wings on Simba's shoulders.] *sighs* Good luck.
Zazu flies off. Nala follows him, with one final look over her shoulder at Simba.
Mufasa	Simba! [Simba flinches and starts walking dejectedly toward Mufasa. As he walks, he accidentally steps into Mufasa's pawprint. He stares down at his tiny paw in the huge indentation. Then he skirts around the pawprint and sits next to Mufasa. He looks up at his father nervously. Mufasa glares into the distance, then looks down at Simba.] Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
Simba bows his head in shame.
Simba	I know.
Mufasa	You could've been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me. And what's worse, you put Nala in danger!
Simba	*breathes heavily* I was just trying to be brave like you.
Simba's voice breaks at the end.
Mufasa	I'm only brave when I have to be. Simba...being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
Simba	But you're not scared of anything.
Mufasa looks wistfully into the distance.
Mufasa	I was today.
Simba	You were?
Mufasa	Yes. [Mufasa ducks down to Simba's level. His voice softens.] I thought I might lose you.
Simba	Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?
Simba smiles. Mufasa nods.
Mufasa	Mm-hmm.
Simba leans in conspiratorially.
Simba	But you know what?
Mufasa leans in, playing along.
Mufasa	What?
Simba	I think those hyenas were even scareder.
Mufasa	*chuckles* [Mufasa grins deviously and lifts one paw.] 'Cause nobody messes with your dad. [Mufasa grabs Simba and gives him a noogie.] Come here, you!
Simba	Oh, no, no! [Simba struggles against Mufasa.] Agh! Uh! [Simba wriggles free.] Uh. [Simba pounces on Mufasa.] Ah! Come here!
Mufasa runs away from Simba, who gives chase.
Mufasa	*laughs*
Simba	*laughs* [Simba pounces on Mufasa.] Gotcha!
Simba tugs on Mufasa's ear with his teeth.
Mufasa and Simba	*laugh*
Simba perches on Mufasa's mane.
Simba	*pants* Dad?
Mufasa looks up at Simba.
Mufasa	Hmm?
Simba	We're pals, right?
Mufasa	*chuckles* Right.
Simba	And we'll always be together, right?
Mufasa sits up, suddenly somber.
Mufasa	Simba...let me tell you something that my father told me. [Mufasa looks up at the stars.] Look at the stars. [Simba looks up at the stars in wonder.] The Great Kings of the Past look down on us from those stars.
Simba glances down at Mufasa.
Simba	Really?
Mufasa glances over one shoulder at Simba.
Mufasa	Yes. [Mufasa and Simba look up at the stars.] So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you...and so will I.
The scene transitions to a geyser-ridden section of the Elephant Graveyard. Banzai and Ed's voices echo up the tall rocky walls.
Banzai	Man, that lousy Mufasa. I won't be able to sit for a week.
Ed grins at Banzai, whose rear is covered in claw marks.
Ed	*laughs*
Banzai	It's not funny, Ed.
Ed	*laughs hysterically*
Banzai	Hey, shut up! *growls*
Banzai lunges at Ed. They scuffle.
Banzai and Ed	*yip*
From a nearby ledge, Shenzi turns and glowers at the feuding Banzai and Ed.
Shenzi	Will you knock it off?!
Banzai and Ed break apart. Banzai points at Ed, who begins chewing on one of his own leg.
Banzai	Well, he started it!
Shenzi	Look at you guys! [Shenzi descends from the ledge.] No wonder we're danglin' at the bottom of the food chain.
Banzai	[with drool hanging from his muzzle] Man, I hate danglin'.
Shenzi	Shyeah. You know, if it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
Shenzi sits, glowering.
Banzai	Yeah. Man, I hate lions.
Shenzi juts her head at Banzai.
Shenzi	So pushy...
Banzai	And hairy...
Shenzi circles Banzai and juts her head at him from his other side.
Shenzi	And stinky...
Banzai	And man, are they...
Banzai and Shenzi jump onto their hind legs, back-to-back.
Banzai and Shenzi	Ugly! *snicker*
Scar	[from offscreen] Oh, [Banzai and Shenzi pause midlaugh, looking fearful. Scar sits on a ledge far above them and is briefly obscured by a steaming geyser.] surely we lions are not all that bad.
Banzai	Oh. [Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed relax.] Oh, Scar, it's just you.
Shenzi	We were afraid it was somebody important.
Banzai	Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
Shenzi	Yeah.
Scar	[scowling] I see.
Banzai	Now, that's power.
Shenzi	Tell me about it. I just hear that name, and I shudder.
Banzai	Mufasa.
Shenzi shudders.
Shenzi	Ooh. [Shenzi nudges Banzai.] Do it again.
Banzai	Mufasa!
Shenzi shudders.
Shenzi	Ooh!
Banzai	Mufasa, [Shenzi shudders, holding her stomach.] Mufasa, [Ed rolls onto his back, giggling and holding his stomach.] Mufasa!
Shenzi	Ooh!
Ed	*sniggers*
Shenzi	Ooh, it tingles me.
Scar holds one paw to his forehead in exasperation.
Scar:	I'm surrounded [Scar rolls his eyes.] by idiots.
Banzai	Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. [Banzai gestures to Ed and Shenzi, who are scratching themselves.] I mean, you're our pal.
Scar looks away, unaffected.
Scar	[monotonously] Charmed.
Shenzi	Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
Shenzi holds up one paw delicately.
Banzai	Yeah. [Banzai juts his head at Scar.] Hey, hey, did you bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy, old pal? Huh? [Scar glowers at Banzai.] Did ya, did ya, did ya?
Scar	I don't think you really deserve this.
Scar pulls out a zebra haunch. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed jump onto their hind legs, tongues lolling.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*slaver*
Scar	I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Scar drops the haunch. The haunch lands at Shenzi's, Banzai's, and Ed's paws.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed begin to devour the haunch.
Shenzi	[with her mouth full] Well, you know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
Banzai	[with his mouth full] Yeah. What were we supposed to do? *gulps* Kill Mufasa?
Scar grins and balances his chin on one paw.
Scar	Precisely.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed look up questioningly.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	Huh?
Scar leaps down the ledge, landing in the middle of the hyenas, who scatter. He walks in-between steaming green geysers.
Scar	 ♪ I know that your powers of retention [Scar circles Ed, who is chewing on a bone.] are as wet as a warthog's backside. But thick as you are, [Scar swats the bone away. Ed salutes him.] pay attention! [Scar circles Ed.] My words are a matter of pride.

Scar crouches, with Banzai and Shenzi in the background.] But we're talking kings and successions. [Banzai and Shenzi snicker. Scar lunges at them, causing them to fall backward onto geysers.] Even you can't be caught unawares! [The geyser explodes, sending Banzai and Shenzi shooting into the air.

Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed emerge from the bone pile, each sporting an animal skull as a hat.
Banzai	Yeah! Be prepared! Yeah-heh! We'll be prepared! Heh! [Banzai peers up at Scar questioningly.] For what?
Scar	For the death of the king.
Banzai climbs up to Scar's ledge.
Banzai	Why? Is he sick?
Scar grabs Banzai by the throat and jerks him close.
Scar	No, fool. We're gonna kill him. And Simba too.
Scar drops Banzai, who lands next to Shenzi and Ed. His skull hat flies off and shatters.
Shenzi	Great idea! Who needs a king?
Shenzi and Ed circle Banzai, who claps.
Banzai and Shenzi	 ♪ No king! No king! La, la, la, la, la, la! ♪

Banzai and Shenzi	Yay! All right! All right! Long live the king!
Ranks upon ranks of hyenas line the ledges behind Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. First the left side, then the right side are illuminated in yellow light.
Hyenas	Long live the king! Long live the king!
The hyena army goose-steps past Scar, who observes from a ledge above.

The red light of the geysers dies out. The scene transitions to a sunny day at the gorge.
Scar	Now, you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.
Simba follows Scar through the gorge.
Simba	Ooh, what is it?
Scar	If I told you, [Simba clambers onto a rock beneath a tree.] it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?
Scar grins.
Simba	If you tell me, I'll still act surprised!
Scar	Ho, ho, ho! [Simba sits.] You are such a naughty boy!
Simba jumps up on Scar's mane.
Simba	Come on, Uncle Scar.
Scar	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is just for you and your daddy. [Simba sits back down.] You know, a sort of father-son [Scar waves vaguely with one paw. Simba sulks.] ...thing. Well, I'd better go get him.
Scar turns to leave. Simba bounds after Scar.
Simba	I'll go with you.
Scar juts his head at Simba, halting him in his tracks.
Scar	No! [Scar composes himself.] *chuckles* No. [Scar guides Simba back onto the rock.] Just stay on this rock. [Simba sits with a mutinous expression on his face.] You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
Simba	You know about that?
Scar	[with lips pursed] Simba, everybody knows about that.
Simba ducks his head in embarrassment.
Simba	Really?
Scar	Oh, yes. Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh? Ooh, [Scar wraps a paw around Simba's shoulders and draws him close.] and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours. Hmm?
Simba	Oh. Okay. [Scar turns to leave.] Hey, Uncle Scar, [Scar pauses in his tracks, with Simba grinning in the background.] will I like the surprise?
Scar	Simba, it's to die for.
Scar grins slyly. Simba sits back down on the rock. Meanwhile, Scar walks off. At the top of the gorge, a herd of wildebeests grazes on grass, while Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed watch from beneath a rocky outcropping.
Banzai	*stomach growls*
Shenzi	Shut up.
Banzai	I can't help it. I'm so hungry. [Banzai stands up and stares longingly at the wildebeest herd.] I gotta have a wildebeest.
Shenzi	Stay put.
Banzai sits and holds up a paw in appeal.
Banzai	Well, can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
Shenzi jabs Banzai in the chest.
Shenzi	No! We wait for the signal from Scar. [Banzai lowers his head sulkily. Scar appears on a ledge above Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, his mane blowing in the wind.] There he is. [Shenzi frowns dramatically.] Let's go.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed move off. Meanwhile, Simba lies on his rock, still moping.
Simba	"Little roar." Puh! [A chameleon hangs down from a branch and starts walking past Simba. Simba's ears perk.] *growls* [The chameleon does not react. Simba bounds after it.] *growls again* [The chameleon does not react. With a devious grin, Simba pounces, landing just behind the chameleon.] *roars* [The chameleon runs off. Simba's roar echoes off the walls of the gorge. Simba smiles. There is a deep rumbling sound, and Simba looks down to where tiny stones are pattering at his paws. He looks up uncertainly. A herd of wildebeests stampedes into the gorge. Simba's expression turns to horror.] *gasps*
Simba runs away. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed chase the wildebeests, nipping at their sides.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
The last of the herd streams into the gorge. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed pause and pace along the edge of the gorge. Simba continues to run, with the herd steadily catching up. Meanwhile, Zazu perches on Mufasa's shoulder. In the distance, dust rises from the gorge.
Zazu	Oh, look, sire. The herd is on the move.
Mufasa looks over one shoulder at the gorge.
Mufasa	Odd.
Scar	[from offscreen] Mufasa, quick. [Scar appears, wild-eyed, on a ledge below Mufasa and Zazu.] Stampede, in the gorge. Simba's down there.
Mufasa	[terrified] Simba?
Simba flees the stampede. As the wildebeests close in, he looks over his shoulder in fear.
Simba	*gasps* [Simba climbs a dead tree in the middle of the gorge.] *grunts* [Mufasa and Scar rush to the gorge. Zazu flies ahead and swoops over the herd. He spots Simba, with a panicked expression. He flies up to Simba.] Zazu, help me!
Zazu	Your father is on the way! [Simba slips and barely manages to hold on to the tree.] Hold on!
Simba clings to the tree for dear life.
Simba	Hurry!
Mufasa and Scar clamber down to a ledge above the stampede. Both search the gorge below with fearful expressions. Zazu flies up and points at Simba.
Zazu	There! There! On that tree!
Simba struggles to hold on to the tree.
Mufasa	Hold on, Simba!
A wildebeest runs into Simba's tree, breaking it. Simba nearly falls.
Simba	*yells* [Mufasa jumps into the stampede, while Simba continues to cling to his tree.] *grunts*
Zazu	Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do? What'll we do?! Ha! I'll go back for help. That's what I'll do. I'll go back for he– [Scar backhands Zazu.] Oof!
Zazu hits the wall of the gorge and falls unconscious. In the meantime, Mufasa races alongside the wildebeests. Simba struggles to hold on to his tree. Mufasa pivots around a wildebeest and runs against the stampede. However, a wildebeest kicks him, knocking him over.
Mufasa	*grunts*
Mufasa looks up in desperation at Simba's struggling form. A wildebeest breaks Simba's tree, sending him flying into the air.
Simba	*screams*
Mufasa leaps into the air, catching Simba in his jaws.
Mufasa	*grunts*
Simba	*gasps*
Mufasa lands with Simba in his jaws. Scar paces along the edge of the gorge, watching the action down below. A wildebeest runs into Mufasa, causing him to let go of Simba.
Mufasa	*roars*
Simba tumbles into the midst of the stampede.
Simba	*grunts*
Simba stands and looks around in terror. Mufasa emerges through the dust and grabs Simba in his jaws once more. A wildebeest falls to the ground behind him. Mufasa leaps onto a ledge and deposits Simba to safety. A wildebeest catches him from behind, drawing him back into the stampede.
Mufasa	*roars*
Simba	Dad!
Mufasa falls among the wildebeests. Simba searches the stampede with increasing distress. At last, Mufasa leaps out of the stampede and latches on to the edge of the gorge.
Mufasa	*roars* [Simba watches with relief. Mufasa begins to scale the side of the gorge, with Simba watching anxiously from his ledge. As Mufasa continues to climb, Simba turns and clambers up the side of the gorge. Mufasa clings to the edge of the gorge for dear life.] Scar! [Scar glares down at Mufasa from the top of the gorge. Mufasa slips and barely manages to hold on.] Brother, help me! [Mufasa's paws scrabble for purchase, kicking bits of rock into the stampede below. Scar glares a moment longer, then rears forward, digging his claws into Mufasa's paws.] *roars*
Scar leans in, grinning evilly.
Scar	Long live the king.
Mufasa's face darkens with horror. Scar heaves Mufasa into the stampede. Mufasa falls, flailing.
Mufasa	*screams*
From atop the gorge, Simba witnesses Mufasa's fall.
Simba	No! [Simba climbs down to the bottom of the gorge as the last of the wildebeests disappear into the dust.] *coughs* Dad? [Simba searches the gorge. The sound of shifting rock catches his attention.] Dad? [A wildebeest emerges through the dust and runs by a broken tree, under which Mufasa's body lies. Simba stares in trepidation. He bounds forward and skirts around Mufasa's body, looking upon him with distress and sorrow. He approaches uncertainly.] Dad? Dad, come on. [Simba nudges against Mufasa's muzzle, trying to get him to stand up.] You gotta get up. Dad? [Simba jumps on Mufasa's mane, shaking him.] We gotta go home. [Simba races around to Mufasa's other side and tugs on his ear. Simba lets go, and Mufasa's head flops back into place. Simba backs away, looking around helplessly. He races off.] Help! [Simba's voice echoes. He pauses and looks around.] Somebody! [Simba's voice echoes. He looks around.] Anybody? [Simba's voice echoes. He sniffles and begins to cry.] Help.
Simba looks back at Mufasa's body and shuffles back to it. He worms under Mufasa's paw and lies down, still sobbing. Scar emerges through the dust. He looks down on Simba.
Scar:	Simba... [Simba looks up with one tear-filled eye.] What have you done?
Simba jumps out from under Mufasa's paw.
Simba	There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me. It was an accident. I-I didn't mean for it to happen.
Scar	[with feigned sympathy] Of course, of course you didn't. [Scar draws Simba against his leg. Simba nuzzles into Scar.] No one ever means for these things to happen. But the king is dead. [Simba looks up at Scar.] And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive. [Simba stares at Scar in dismay. He slowly lowers his head and nuzzles back into Scar's leg.] *gasps* [Simba looks up.] What will your mother think?
Simba:	[through labored breathing] What am I gonna do?
Scar leans toward Simba, who backs away.
Scar	Run away, Simba. [Simba glances at Mufasa.] Run. Run away, and never return. [With a backward glance, Simba takes off. Scar watches him run, with a pleased look. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed prowl up behind Scar.] Kill him.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed take off after Simba.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*bark*
Simba pauses at a dead-end in the gorge.
Simba	*pants* [Simba looks behind him to see that Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed are advancing on him.] *gasps*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*growl*
Simba runs away.
Simba	*pants*
Simba slips through a crack in the walls. Banzai nearly claws Simba from behind.
Banzai	*snarls*
Simba runs along the top of the gorge. He pulls up short at a steep ledge. Below him is a large thorn patch.
Simba	*gasps*
Simba looks over his shoulder with fright. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed race toward him.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*bark*
Simba launches himself over the cliffside. He tumbles down the ledge.
Simba	*grunts*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed pursue Simba down the ledge.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*bark*
Simba tumbles over the ledge into the thorn patch.
Simba	*grunts*
Simba looks up fearfully at Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. They pursue him down the ledge.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*pant*
Simba climbs through the thorns.
Simba	*pants*
Banzai	Whoa! [Banzai tries to slow himself down to keep from falling into the thorn hedge.] Phew! [Shenzi knocks into Banzai from behind. He nearly falls in.] Uh! [Ed knocks into Shenzi from behind, which sends Banzai flying into the thorn hedge.] Ah! [Banzai jumps out of the thorn hedge, covered in thorns, clinging to his hindquarters.] Yow!
Shenzi and Ed watch from the ledge.
Shenzi and Ed	*laugh*
Banzai clambers onto the ledge, still covered in thorns.
Banzai	Ah! Oh! Yeow!
Banzai walks onto the ledge, wincing with every step. Ed rolls onto his back.
Shenzi and Ed	*laugh*
Shenzi looks back at Simba.
Shenzi	Hey! [Simba runs off into the sunset.] There he goes! There he goes!
Banzai pulls a thorn out of his paw.
Banzai	So go get him.
Shenzi	There ain't no way I'm going in there. What, you want me to come out looking like you, [Shenzi glances back at Banzai.] cactus butt?
Banzai pulls a thorn out of his rear and spits it at Ed.
Ed	*yelps*
Banzai	But we gotta finish the job.
Shenzi	Well, [Banzai sidles up next to Shenzi.] he's as good as dead out there anyway. And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Banzai	Yeah! [yelling at Simba] You hear that? If you ever come back, [voice echoing] we'll kill ya!
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*laugh*
The hyenas turn back, while Simba races off into the sunset. The scene transitions to a night at Pride Rock. Scar speaks from atop a nearby boulder to the lionesses, who are gathered below him.
Scar	Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy. But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live... [Scar puts a paw to his forehead in feigned sorrow. The lionesses bow their heads mournfully.] For me, [Zazu rests a comforting wing on Sarabi's paw.] it is a deep, personal loss. [Nala sheds a tear and nuzzles into her mother's leg.] So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne. [Behind Scar, the shadows of hyenas stretch tall on Pride Rock.] Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet...
Zazu looks up.
Zazu	*gasps*
Scar	...the dawning of a new era, [The lionesses gasp and look up. Scar bounds toward Pride Rock. Hyenas slink in among the lionesses.] in which lion and hyena come together [Scar begins to ascend Pride Rock.] in a great and glorious future!
From all directions, hyenas stream toward Pride Rock.
Hyenas	*cackle*
Rafiki watches the coronation from afar. He bows and shakes his head.
Rafiki	*sighs*
The scene transitions to Rafiki sitting sadly in his baobab tree. He sheds a tear and wipes it away. He swipes his hand across the painting of Simba, smudging it. The scene transitions to the desert, where Simba is passed out under the hot sun. Several vultures swoop overhead, cawing. They gather around him and begin to feast. Suddenly, Pumbaa charges at the vultures, with Timon riding in his mane.
Timon and Pumbaa	Yah!
Timon and Pumbaa shoo the vultures away.
Timon	Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
Pumbaa	I love this!
Timon	Whoo!
Pumbaa	Bowling for buzzards.
Timon	Hee, hee, hee. [Timon dusts himself off.] Gets 'em every time. *laughs*
Pumbaa	[from offscreen] Uh-oh. [Timon glances back at Pumbaa.] Hey, Timon, you better come look. I think it's still alive.
Timon	[with a disgusted look] Ewww. [Timon approaches, dusting off his hands.] All righty, what have we got here? [Timon sniffs Simba. He lifts Simba's paw off his face.] *grunts* [Timon darts away in terror.] Jeez, it's a lion! [Timon jumps into Pumbaa's mane and pulls his ears as if they're reins.] Run, Pumbaa! Move it!
Pumbaa	Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion. [Pumbaa ducks down to Simba's level.] Look at him. He's so cute and all alone. [Pumbaa looks over one shoulder at Timon.] Can we keep him?
Timon	Pumbaa, [Timon tugs on one of Pumbaa's ears and shouts into it, creating an echo effect.] are you nuts? [Timon darts onto Pumbaa's head and grabs his ears.] You're talking about a lion. [Timon crawls onto Pumbaa's snout.] Lions eat guys like us.
Pumbaa bows his head, causing Timon to fall to the ground.
Pumbaa	But he's so little.
From the ground, Timon wags a finger at Pumbaa.
Timon	He's gonna get bigger.
Pumbaa	Maybe he'll be on our side.
Timon	Ha! [Timon stands.] That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. [Timon dusts himself off.] Maybe he'll be... [Timon pulls up short and holds up a finger as he has a sudden realization.] Hey, I've got it. What if he's on our side? [Timon gestures dramatically. He puts a pensive finger to his chin.] You know, having a lion around [Timon grasps onto Pumbaa's nostrils.] might not be such a bad idea.
Timon climbs into Pumbaa's mane. Pumbaa struts around to Simba's side.
Pumbaa	So we're keeping him?
Timon	Pfft! Of course. Who's the brains of this outfit?
Pumbaa lifts Simba in his tusks.
Pumbaa	Uhhh...
Timon	My point exactly. [Timon wipes his forehead.] Geez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here and find some shade.
Pumbaa waddles off, with Timon in his mane and Simba in his tusks. The scene transitions to the edge of the desert. Simba lies beside a jungle pool, with Timon and Pumbaa nearby. Timon splashes water into Simba's face, and Simba wakes up groggily.
Simba	*groans*
Timon	You okay, kid?
Simba	I guess so.
Pumbaa	You nearly died.
Timon gestures to himself.
Timon	I saved you.
Pumbaa turns on Timon angrily.
Pumbaa	*snorts*
Timon	Well, uh, Pumbaa helped. [Pumbaa beams.] A little.
Simba stands up and walks back toward the desert.
Simba	Thanks for your help.
Timon	Hey, where you going?
Simba	Nowhere.
Timon watches Simba walk away.
Timon	Gee, he looks blue.
Pumbaa	I'd say brownish-gold.
Timon	No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Pumbaa	Oh.
Timon and Pumbaa stride after Simba.
Pumbaa	Kid, what's eatin' you?
Timon	Nothin'. [Simba halts and sits down.] He's at the top of the food chain. *laughs* [Timon elbows Simba, who is unresponsive.] The food chain. [Pumbaa looks on sadly.] Heh, heh. Ahem. So, where you from?
Simba stands up and walks away.
Simba	Who cares? I can't go back.
Timon bounds in front of Simba.
Timon	Ah, you're an outcast. That's great. So are we.
Pumbaa sidles up next to Timon.
Pumbaa	What'd you do, kid?
Simba sits.
Simba	Something terrible. But I don't want to talk about it.
Timon crosses his arms.
Timon	Good. We don't want to hear about it.
Pumbaa	[in an aside to Timon] Come on, Timon. [to Simba] Anything we can do?
Simba	Not unless you can change the past.
Pumbaa	You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon [Pumbaa nudges Timon.] here says, "You gotta put your behind in your past."
Timon waves his arms.
Timon	No, no, no.
Pumbaa puts a hoof to his chin in confusion.
Pumbaa	Uh... I mean...
Timon	Amateur. Lie down before you hurt yourself. [Pumbaa slumps sadly.] It's "You gotta put your past behind ya." Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
Simba	Right.
Timon pokes Simba in the nose.
Timon	Wrong! [Timon gestures dramatically.] When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world!
Simba	Well, that's not what I was taught.
Timon	Then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me. Ahem. "Hakuna matata."
Simba	What?
Pumbaa	[emphatically] "Hakuna matata." It means "no worries."

Timon	Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you? *laughs*
Pumbaa	*laughs* You know, kid, these two words will solve all your problems!
Timon gestures at Pumbaa.
Timon	That's right. Take Pumbaa for example. [Pumbaa beams.] Why...  ♪ When he was a young warthog... ♪ 
Pumbaa stands in a spotlight.
Pumbaa	 ♪ When I was a young warthog... ♪ 
Pumbaa lifts an arm into the air. Timon cleans out one ear.
Timon	Very nice.
Pumbaa	Thanks.
A flashback starts. Pumbaa's tail bobs through grass as he heads toward a water hole in the distance, around which many animals are gathered.
Timon	 ♪ [voiceover] He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal. [Pumbaa struts between trees. Behind him, monkeys fall to the ground, holding their noses.] He could clear the savanna after every meal. ♪

Simba tilts his head in confusion. Timon pulls on a vine, lifting Pumbaa into the air on a swing.
Timon and Pumbaa	 ♪ Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase. [Simba watches Pumbaa ascend, smiling. Pumbaa swoops down and picks up Timon.] Hakuna matata! [Timon and Pumbaa swing back and forth in front of Simba. He gets up and shakes his rump to the rhythm.] Ain't no passing craze! ♪

The scene transitions. Timon lifts a leaf, allowing Simba a view of his and Pumbaa's lush jungle home. Simba stares in awe.
Timon	Welcome to our humble home.
Simba	[from offscreen] You live here?
Timon	[from offscreen] We live wherever we want.
Pumbaa leans in front of Simba, blocking his view.
Pumbaa	Yep! Home is where your rump rests. Heh.
Simba	It's beautiful!
The scene transitions. Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa are striding side-by-side through the jungle.
Pumbaa	*belches* I'm starved!
Simba	I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole zebra.
Timon stops in his tracks.
Timon	[disturbed] Ah. We're fresh out of zebra.
Simba:	Any antelope?
Timon shakes his head.
Timon	Nuh-uh.
Simba	[with concern] Hippo?
Timon shakes his head.
Timon	Nope. [Timon approaches Simba.] Listen, kid, if you live with us, [Timon gestures to himself.] you have to eat like us. [Timon strides away. He approaches a moss-covered log.] Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub.
Timon points at the log. Pumbaa lifts the trunk with his snout, revealing grubs.
Simba	Ewww, what's that?
Timon holds up a wriggling worm.
Timon	A grub. What's it look like?
Simba	[with a disgusted look] Ewww. Gross!
Timon licks his fingers. The grub is gone.
Timon	Mmm. Tastes like chicken.
Pumbaa slurps a worm out of the ground. Simba recoils.
Pumbaa	Slimy yet satisfying.
Timon grabs a beetle off a dirt mound.
Timon	These are rare delicacies. Mmm. [Timon takes a bite out of the beetle.] Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.
Timon eats the rest of the beetle.
Pumbaa	[with his mouth full of grubs] You'll learn to love 'em!
Timon strides alongside the log, holding a leaf full of grubs. He grabs a beetle and adds it to the pile.
Timon	I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life. [Timon sticks his hand in a hole in the log. Grubs pour out of the opening.] No rules. No responsibilities. [Timon hefts a beetle.] Ooh! The little cream-filled kind. [Timon eats the beetle. He approaches Simba, still holding the leaf.] And best of all, no worries. [Timon lifts the leaf into Simba's face.] Well, kid?
Simba hesitantly selects a worm.
Simba	Oh, well. Hakuna matata. [Simba swallows the worm with some difficulty. He smacks his jaws in disgust.] Slimy... [Simba's expression changes to joy.] yet satisfying.
Timon	That's it.
Grubs flood the screen, then disappear to reveal Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa striding across a log. First, Simba is a cub. Then he grows into an adolescent. Finally, he becomes an adult with a full mane. The scene transitions to Timon and Pumbaa dancing through the jungle.

Scar	You know the law. [Zazu covers his beak with his wings.] Never, ever mention that name in my presence. [Scar sticks his muzzle through the bars of the cage.] I am the king!
Zazu is thrown backward by Scar's muzzle.
Zazu	Yes, sire, you are the king. I...I... Well, I only mentioned it to illustrate [Zazu stands.] the differences in your royal managerial approaches. *laughs nervously*
Banzai	[from offscreen] Hey, boss!
Scar	Oh, what is it this time?
Scar strides away from the cage. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed enter Pride Rock.
Banzai	We got a bone to pick with you.
Shenzi	[in an aside to Banzai] I'll handle this. [to Scar] Scar, there's no food, no water...
Scar rolls his eyes.
Banzai	Yeah. It's dinnertime, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrées!
Scar	It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting...
Scar makes a helpless facial expression.
Banzai	Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
Scar	Oh, [Scar gestures at Zazu.] eat Zazu.
Zazu waves his wings dramatically.
Zazu	Oh, you wouldn't want me. I'd be so tough and gamey and ewww.
Scar	*chuckles* Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous. All you need is a little garlic.
Banzai	[in an aside to Shenzi and Ed] I thought things were bad under Mufasa.
Scar jerks around.
Scar	What did you say?!
Banzai	I said, "Muf"... [Shenzi nudges Banzai.] I said, uh, "Qué pasa?"
Banzai and Shenzi grin innocently.
Scar	Good. Now get out.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed shuffle past Scar. They pause in the entryway of Pride Rock and look back at Scar.
Banzai	Yeah, but we're still hungry.
Scar	[from offscreen] Out!
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed flee.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
Ed	Ooh!
The scene transitions to the jungle at night.
Simba	[from offscreen, echoing] *belches*
Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa lie on their backs in the grass.
Timon	Whoa! Nice one, Simba.
Simba	Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed.
Pumbaa	Me too. [Pumbaa rubs his stomach.] I ate like a pig.
Simba	Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Pumbaa	Oh. Right.
Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa	*sigh contentedly*
Pumbaa	Timon?
Timon	Yeah?
Pumbaa	Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?
Timon	Pumbaa, I don't wonder. I know.
Pumbaa	Oh? What are they?
Timon	They're fireflies. Fireflies that, uh, [Timon gestures vaguely.] got stuck up in that big bluish-black thing.
Pumbaa	Oh, gee. I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
Timon	Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Pumbaa	Simba, what do you think?
Simba	Well, I don't know.
Pumbaa	Oh, come on.
Timon	Well, come on, Simba.
Pumbaa	Give, give, give, give.
Timon	Come on.
Pumbaa	We told you ours. Please?
Timon	Give, give.
Simba	Well, somebody once told me that the Great Kings of the Past are up there, watching over us.
Pumbaa	Really?
Timon	You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us? Pfft! *laughs*
Pumbaa	*laughs*
Simba	*laughs halfheartedly*
Timon	Who told you something like that?
Simba	Yeah, yeah...
Timon	What mook made that up?
Simba:	Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?
Timon:	Oh, you're killing me, Simba.
Simba:	Yeah...
Simba stares up at the stars, downcast.
Timon	Oh. [After a moment, Simba gets up and leaves. Timon looks at Pumbaa in confusion.] Was it something I said?
Simba walks to a ledge, his head drooped. He looks up at the stars, then collapses, sending a shower of milkweed floss into the air.
Simba	*sighs*
The scene transitions to the milkweed floss being carried on the wind. It drifts over Rafiki's tree. Rafiki catches some in his hand and sniffs it experimentally.
Rafiki	Hmm. [Rafiki climbs down into the branches of his tree. He sits and puts the milkweed floss into an empty turtle shell. He shakes the shell.] *hums* [Rafiki grabs a gourd that is hanging in his tree, breaks it in two, and munches on one half.] Hmm. [Rafiki ducks down toward the milkweed floss.] Simba? [Rafiki looks at the smeared painting of Simba.] He's... He's alive? H-He's alive! [Rafiki bounds across the tree.] *laughs* [Rafiki grabs his staff. He races toward the painting and dips his fingers in red paint.] *laughs* [Rafiki draws a mane on the painting of Simba.] It is time.
The scene transitions to the jungle. Timon and Pumbaa stride through the foliage, dancing.

Pumbaa hums "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" while he stalks the beetle. It flits away from him.
Pumbaa	Huh? [The beetle lands on a nearby log. Pumbaa drops into a hunter's crouch and attempts to sneak up on it. The beetle turns around hastily, and Pumbaa hides behind a tree. The beetle turns back around and climbs over the log. Pumbaa licks his chops and follows. There is a sound behind him, which causes him to glance over one shoulder.] Timon? [Behind him, there is a seemingly empty field. Pumbaa shrugs and climbs over the log.] *grunts*
Pumbaa stares at the beetle. Behind the beetle, Nala crouches in the field. The beetle flies away, and Nala wriggles her haunches in anticipation of a hunt.
Nala:	*growls*
Pumbaa	*screams*
Nala breaks into a run.
Nala	*snarls*
Pumbaa stumbles away in terror.
Pumbaa	*pants*
Pumbaa turns and races away, with Nala in hot pursuit. She chases him into the jungle.
Nala	*roars*
Timon	Pumbaa? [Nala chases Pumbaa around the jungle. Timon races to Pumbaa's aid.] Pumbaa! Pumbaa! Pumbaa! Pumbaa! [Pumbaa attempts to squeeze under a tree root but gets stuck. Timon skids to a halt in front of him.] Hey, what's going on?
Pumbaa	[screaming, with spittle flying] She's gonna eat me!
Timon climbs on top of the tree root.
Timon	Huh? [Nala charges toward Pumbaa.] Whoa! [Timon jumps down and pushes on Pumbaa's rump in an attempt to free him.] Jeez, why do I always have to save your... [Timon turns and stares at Nala in terror.] *screams*
Simba jumps over the log, attacking Nala.
Simba	*roars*
Simba and Nala fight.
Simba and Nala	*roar*
From on top of the tree root, Timon pats Pumbaa's rump reassuringly.
Timon	Don't worry, buddy, I'm here for you. Everything's gonna be okay.
Pumbaa looks anxiously over one shoulder.
Pumbaa	Huh?
Timon watches Simba and Nala fight.
Timon	Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular! The jugular! [Timon approaches Pumbaa and points over his shoulder at Simba.] See? I told you he'd come in handy.
Simba and Nala roll through the foliage.
Simba and Nala	*roar*
Nala pins Simba, who looks up in sudden recognition. She glares down at him.
Nala	*growls*
Simba	Nala? [Nala stops growling and lets Simba up. Simba approaches her.] Is it really you?
Nala	Who are you?
Simba	It's me, Simba.
Nala	Simba? [Simba nods excitedly. Nala's face breaks into a grin.] Whoa!
Simba	Whoa!
Simba and Nala nuzzle and bound around one another joyously.
Nala	How did you...?
Simba	But how did you...? [A confused Timon watches with his mouth wide open.] Who...? Wow!
Nala	Where did you come from?
Simba	This is gr... It's great to see ya!
Nala	[in the background] It's great to see you!
Timon jumps off the tree root and walks toward Simba and Nala.
Timon	Hey, what's goin' on here?
Simba	[to Nala] What are you doing here?
Nala	What do you mean what am I doing here? What are you doing here?
Timon stands in-between Simba and Nala.
Timon	Hey! What's goin' on here?!
Simba looks down at Timon, as if noticing him for the first time.
Simba	Timon, this is Nala. She's my best friend.
Timon puts his hands on his hips.
Timon	Friend?
Simba	Yeah. [Simba looks over one shoulder at Pumbaa.] Hey, Pumbaa, come over here!
Pumbaa wriggles out from under the tree root. He looks over one shoulder at Simba.
Pumbaa	Huh?
Simba	Nala, this is Pumbaa. [Pumbaa approaches Simba, Nala, and Timon.] Pumbaa. Nala.
Pumbaa	Pleased to make your acquiantance.
Nala	The pleasure's all mine.
Timon	How do you do? [Timon's tone becomes more aggressive. He holds out his arms on either side.] Whoa, whoa! Timeout. [Timon makes the sports gesture for timeout.] Let me get this straight. [Timon puts a hand to his forehead in exasperation.] You know her. She knows you. But she wants to eat him. And everybody's okay with this? [Timon jumps into the air.] Did I miss something?! *pants*
Simba ducks down to Timon's level.
Simba	Relax, Timon.
Nala	Wait till everyone [Simba lifts his head to meet Nala's gaze.] finds out you've been here all this time. And your mother... What will she think?
Simba	[distressed] S-She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know.
Nala	Well, of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead.
Simba	They do?
Nala	Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
Simba looks away.
Simba	He did? [haltingly] What else did he tell you?
Nala	What else matters? You're alive. And that means...you're the king.
Timon	King? Pfft! [Timon approaches Simba and Nala.] Lady, have you got [Timon leans on one of Simba's paws.] your lions crossed.
Nala ducks down to Timon's level.
Pumbaa	[in awe] King? Your Majesty! [Pumbaa bows to Simba.] I gravel at your feet.
Pumbaa aggressively kisses one of Simba's paws. Disgusted, Simba pulls his paw away from Pumbaa.
Simba	Stop it.
Timon approaches Pumbaa.
Timon	It's not "gravel." It's "grovel." And don't! [Timon whacks Pumbaa's snout.] He's not the king. [Timon glances over one shoulder at Simba.] Are ya?
Simba	[hastily] No!
Nala	Simba!
Simba	No, I'm not the king! [Simba stands.] Maybe I was gonna be, [Simba strides away.] but that was a long time ago.
Timon puts his hands on his hips.
Timon	Let me get this straight. You're the king? And you never told us?
Simba turns around and strides toward Timon.
Simba	Look, I'm still the same guy.
Timon pumps a fist into the air.
Timon	But with power!
Nala ducks down to Timon's level. She smiles patiently.
Nala	Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
Timon	Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, [Timon nudges Pumbaa's snout.] right, Simba?
Simba	Mmm. Maybe you'd better go.
Timon stares at Simba in consternation. He holds up his arms in surrender.
Timon	It starts. You think you know a guy.
Timon and Pumbaa slink away uncertainly. Pumbaa looks over one shoulder at Simba.
Pumbaa	*groans*
Simba	Timon and Pumbaa. You learn to love 'em. [Nala walks away with her head bowed.] What? [Simba follows her.] What is it?
Nala	It's like you're back from the dead. [Nala looks at Simba.] You don't know how much this will mean to everyone. [Nala looks away.] What it means to me.
Simba	Hey, it's okay.
Nala nuzzles Simba.
Nala	I've really missed you.
Simba	I've missed you too.
Simba nuzzles Nala back.
Simba and Nala	*purr*
From the foliage, Timon and Pumbaa watch Simba and Nala nuzzle.
Timon	*snorts* I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.
Timon swats a leaf out of his face. He grumpily rests his elbows on a nearby log. Pumbaa emerges from behind a leaf as well.
Pumbaa	Oh, sorry.
Timon	Not you. [Timon gestures to Simba and Nala.] Them! [Simba and Nala stride off into the jungle.] Him, her, [Timon clasps his hands sarcastically.] alone.
Pumbaa	What's wrong with that?
Timon crosses his arms.

Timon	 ♪ And they don't have a clue! ♪ 
Pumbaa	Who?

He slides down Pumbaa's snout.] And with all this romantic atmosphere, [Timon leans on one elbow grumpily.] disaster's in the air! ♪ 
Timon gestures after Simba and Nala. Pumbaa follows his gaze. Meanwhile, Simba and Nala climb down a ridge. A waterfall flows nearby.

Simba and Nala pause to drink from a pool.

Simba swings in on a vine and falls into the pool.

Nala	*gasps*
Nala swims back to shore and clambers out of the pool, looking rattled.

The scene transitions. Simba and Nala cross a log in the jungle.
Simba	Isn't this a great place?
Nala	It is beautiful. But I don't understand something. You've been alive all this time. Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
Simba	Well, I just needed to [Simba rests his paws on a series of hanging vines.] get out on my own. [Simba hops into the vines and lounges in them, as if they're a swing.] Live my own life. And I did, and it's great!
Nala	We've really needed you at home.
Simba	No one needs me.
Nala	[forcefully] Yes, we do. You're the king.
Simba	Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the king. Scar is.
Nala	Simba, [Nala rests her paws on the vines.] he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.
Simba	[shocked] What?
Nala	Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no water. [Nala hops back down to the ground.] Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
Simba flops in the vines.
Simba	I can't go back.
Nala	Why?
Simba hops back down to the ground and strides away.
Simba	You wouldn't understand.
Nala	What wouldn't I understand?
Simba pauses and looks over one shoulder at Nala.
Simba	No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna matata.
Nala tilts her head in confusion.
Nala	What?
Simba	Hakuna matata. It's something I learned out here. [Simba walks past Nala.] Look, sometimes, bad things happen...
Nala	Simba!
Simba	And there's nothing you can do about it. [Simba strides away.] So why worry?
Nala hops off the log and pursues Simba.
Nala	Because it's your responsibility!
Simba glares down at Nala.
Simba	Well, what about you? You left?
Nala	[passionately] I left to find help! And I found you. Don't you understand? You're our only hope.
Simba	Sorry.
Nala	What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember.
Simba	You're right. I'm not. Now are you satisfied?
Nala	No. Just disappointed.
Simba	You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Simba jumps off the log and strides away. Nala turns to watch him leave.
Nala	Good. At least one of us does.
Simba's expression turns to rage. He flips around.
Simba	Listen! You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? You don't even know what I've been through.
Simba turns and stalks off into the jungle.
Nala	I would if you'd just tell me.
Simba	[without turning around] Forget it!
Nala	Fine!
Simba stalks into an empty field and begins pacing back and forth.
Simba	She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove anyway? It won't change anything. You can't change the past. [Simba pauses and looks up at the night sky.] You said you'd always be there for me! But you're not. [Simba ducks his head sorrowfully.] And it's because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault. *sobs*
Rafiki	 ♪ [from offscreen] Asante sana, squash banana, we we nugu, imi mi apana. [Simba glances up in irritation to where Rafiki is dancing in the trees.] Asante sana, squash banana, we we nugu, imi mi apana. Asante sana, squash banana, we we nugu, imi mi apana. [Simba leaves.] *hums* [Rafiki swings onto a closer branch.] *chuckles* ♪ 
Rafiki watches Simba depart. Simba crosses a log and sits, staring down at his reflection in the water below. He lies down and keeps staring.
Simba	*sighs*
Suddenly, a rock disturbs the water. Simba looks up in irritation.
Rafiki	 ♪ Asante sana, squash banana, [Rafiki hangs from a vine on a nearby tree.] we we nugu, imi mi apana. ♪  [Rafiki flips over.] Ooh!
Simba	Come on. Will you cut it out?
Rafiki drops from the tree. Simba turns to leave.
Rafiki	Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back! *laughs*
Simba strides away.
Simba	Creepy little monkey. [Rafiki catches up with Simba and hobbles alongside him.] Will you stop following me? [Simba halts.] Who are you?
Rafiki	The question is, [Rafiki leans in close.] who are you?
Simba stares, mouth wide open. He bows his head.
Simba	Phew. I thought I knew. [Simba looks away.] Now I'm not so sure.
Rafiki	Well, I know who you are. [Rafiki grabs Simba's ear and tugs him closer.] Shhh. Come here. It's a secret. [Simba leans in close.]  ♪ Asante sana, squash banana, [Rafiki dances away from Simba.] we we nugu, imi mi apana! ♪ 
Simba	Ugh! Enough already! [Simba looks over one shoulder at Rafiki.] What is that supposed to mean anyway?
Rafiki pauses and points at Simba.
Rafiki	It means you're a baboon, [Rafiki gestures to himself.] and I'm not. [Rafiki leans on his staff.] *laughs*
Simba walks off in the opposite direction.
Simba	[bemused] I think you're a little confused.
Rafiki materializes in front of Simba and jabs him in the nose. Simba stops.
Rafiki	Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused. You don't even know who you are.
Simba stalks off angrily.
Simba	Oh, and I suppose you know.
Rafiki	[to Simba's back] Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.
Simba stops, his mouth wide open in shock.
Simba	*gasps*
Simba looks back at Rafiki.
Rafiki	Bye.
Rafiki runs away. Simba chases after him.
Simba	Hey, wait! [Simba runs through the field, over the log, and to the edge of the jungle. Rafiki sits cross-legged on a rock, eyes closed, meditating.] *pants* You knew my father?
Rafiki	[without opening his eyes] Correction: I know your father.
Simba bows his head mournfully.
Simba	I hate to tell you this, [Rafiki opens his eyes.] but he died...a long time ago.
Rafiki lifts a hand.
Rafiki	Nope! Wrong again. [Rafiki darts away from Simba, who stares at him in confusion.] Ha, ha, ha! [Rafiki cavorts to the edge of the jungle, then turns back to face Simba and gestures dramatically.] He's alive! And I'll show him to you. [Rafiki waves Simba forward.] You follow old Rafiki. He knows the way. Come on! [Simba follows Rafiki to the edge of the jungle. He looks hesitantly over one shoulder, then enters. He crawls under and over dark, twisting foliage.] Don't dawdle. [From a tree, Rafiki waves Simba forward.] Hurry up!
Rafiki races away. Simba scrambles to follow him.
Simba	Hey, whoa, wait, wait!
Rafiki pauses.
Rafiki	Come on. Come on!
Rafiki takes off again. Simba tears after him.
Simba	*pants*
Rafiki runs through the branches of trees over Simba's head.
Rafiki	 ♪ Asante sana, squash banana, we we nugu, imi mi apana! ♪ 
Simba	Would you slow down?
Simba slips and slides down a ridge. He hastily gets back up and keeps running.
Rafiki	[from offscreen] *cackles*
Rafiki's voice echoes. Simba runs, bulling his way through vines.
Simba	*grunts*
Simba looks up desperately at Rafiki, who is swinging on vines overhead.
Rafiki	*laughs* [Simba continues to run and gets smacked in the face with a branch. Suddenly, Rafiki appears in front of Simba with his hand outstretched.] Stop! [Simba skids to a halt. Rafiki puts a finger to his lips.] Shhh. [Rafiki bounds over to some tall grass and pulls it aside. He motions with his staff and whispers.] Look down there.
Simba approaches Rafiki, and the two exchange looks. Simba inhales, then enters a clearing with a pool of water. He peers down at his reflection, and his expression falls.
Simba	*sighs* That's not my father. [Simba sits up.] That's just my reflection.
Rafiki touches Simba's mane.
Rafiki	No. [Rafiki points at the water.] Look harder. [Simba looks back at his reflection, which begins to ripple and warp.] You see? [Mufasa's face replaces Simba's in the water.] He lives in you.
Simba's eyes widen.
Mufasa	[from offscreen] Simba.
Simba looks up.
Simba	Father?
In the clouds above Simba, Mufasa's ghost strides into view.
Mufasa	Simba, you have forgotten me.
Simba's mane blows in the wind. His expression is pained.
Simba	No. How could I?
Clouds churn around Mufasa, outlining his head and shoulders.
Mufasa	You have forgotten who you are and so forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. [sternly] You are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the Circle of Life.
Simba	How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.
Light shines behind Mufasa.
Mufasa	Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true king.
Simba stares in awe at Mufasa.
Simba	*breathes heavily*
Mufasa's head retreats with the clouds.
Mufasa	Remember who you are.
Simba chases the retreating clouds into an open field.
Simba	No, please! Don't leave me!
Mufasa	[from offscreen] Remember.
Simba	Father!
Mufasa	[from offscreen] Remember.
Simba slows.
Simba	Don't leave me.
Mufasa	[from offscreen] Remember.
Simba sits. The clouds clear overhead. A breeze stirs Simba's mane. After a moment, Rafiki approaches from behind Simba.
Rafiki	What was that? Heh, heh! The weather. Pbbt! Very peculiar, don't you think?
Simba	[thoughtfully] Yeah. [Simba looks up.] Looks like the winds are changing.
Rafiki strokes his chin.
Rafiki	Ah, change is good.
Simba	Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do, but...going back means I'll have to face my past. I've been running from it for so long. [Rafiki smacks Simba with his staff. Simba rears onto his hind legs and holds his head.] Ow! Jeez! What was that for?
Rafiki spreads his arms wide.
Rafiki	It doesn't matter! It's in the past. *laughs*
Simba rubs his head.
Simba	Yeah, but it still hurts.
Simba lowers his paw and examines it. Rafiki touches Simba consolingly.
Rafiki	Oh, yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it. [Rafiki tries to hit Simba with his staff again, but Simba ducks.] Ah! You see? [Rafiki puts one hand on his hip.] So what are you going to do?
Simba	First, I'm gonna take your stick.
Simba grabs Rafiki's staff in his teeth and tosses it into the grass. Rafiki runs after his staff.
Rafiki	No, no, no, no, no! Not the stick! [Rafiki grabs his staff. He turns back.] Hey! Where are you going?
Simba runs off into the grass. He looks over one shoulder at Rafiki.
Simba	I'm going back!
Rafiki	Good! Go on! [Rafiki makes shooing motions.] Get out of here! *laughs* Whoo! *laughs* [Several shooting stars streak by overhead.] Whoo! [Rafiki lifts his staff over his head.] Whoo!
The scene transitions to the jungle. Timon and Pumbaa are fast asleep. Pumbaa lies on his back, while Timon rests on Pumbaa's belly.
Timon and Pumbaa	*snore*
Pumbaa	[muttering in his sleep] Grubs, grubs...
Timon and Pumbaa	*snore*
Nala approaches and pokes Timon.
Nala	Hey. Hey, wake up.
Timon sleepily lifts his head and looks behind him. Nala's face is incredibly close to his.
Timon	*screams*
Timon hides behind Pumbaa, who is jolted awake.
Timon and Pumbaa	*scream*
Nala	It's okay. It's o... Whoa! Whoa! It's okay. It's me.
Timon and Pumbaa	*sigh in relief*
Timon walks across Pumbaa's snout and belly toward Nala.
Timon	Don't ever do that again. [Timon turns away, holding his forehead in exasperation.] Carnivores. Oy!
Nala	Have you guys seen Simba?
Timon looks back at Nala.
Timon	I thought he was with you.
Nala	He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he?
Rafiki	[from offscreen] Ho, ho, ho! [Rafiki sits in the branches of a nearby tree.] You won't find him here. Ha, ha! The king [Rafiki bows.] has returned.
Nala	I can't believe it. [Nala's eyes widen.] He's gone back!
Timon hops off Pumbaa and looks up at Rafiki.
Timon	Gone back? What do you mean? [Rafiki has mysteriously disappeared.] Hey! What's goin' on here? [Timon gestures at where Rafiki was sitting.] Who's the monkey?
Nala	Simba's gone back to challenge Scar.
Timon	Who?
Nala	Scar.
Pumbaa tilts his head questioningly.
Pumbaa	Who's got a scar?
Nala shakes her head.
Nala	No, no, no. It's his uncle.
Timon	The monkey's his uncle?
Pumbaa approaches and sits next to Timon.
Nala	No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king.
Timon and Pumbaa	Oooh.
The scene transitions to the desert. Simba runs across the sand toward the Pride Lands. He arrives to find that his homeland has become a desolate ruin, with skeletons lying everywhere. He looks around sadly, then climbs onto a ridge with a full view of Pride Rock. He glares in its direction.
Nala	[from offscreen] Simba! [Simba looks over one shoulder.] Wait up! [Nala sidles up next to Simba.] It's awful, isn't it?
Simba	I didn't want to believe you.
Nala	What made you come back?
Simba	I finally got some sense knocked into me, [Simba jerks upward with his chin.] and I've got the bump to prove it. Besides, this is my kingdom. [Simba draws himself up to his full height and stares at the Pride Lands.] If I don't fight for it, who will?
Nala approaches.
Nala	I will.
Simba looks at Nala.
Simba	It's gonna be dangerous.
Nala	[coyly] Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger. Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Timon	[from offscreen] I see [Timon and Pumbaa stand behind Simba and Nala. Timon's hands are on his hips.] nothing funny about this.
Simba and Nala look over their shoulders at Timon and Pumbaa.
Simba	Timon! Pumbaa! What are you doing here?
Pumbaa	At your service, my liege.
Pumbaa bows to Simba. Timon approaches and stares at the Pride Lands in disgust.
Timon	Awww. We're gonna fight your uncle...for this?
Simba	Yes, Timon. This is my home.
Timon	Oh. [out of the corner of his mouth] Talk about your fixer-upper. [in his normal voice] Well, Simba, if it's important to you, we're with you to the end.
Timon bows to Simba, who smiles down at him fondly. Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa stare at Pride Rock in the distance. Stormclouds gather overhead, and there is a grumble of thunder. The scene transitions to a rocky area near Pride Rock. Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa hide behind a log. Hyenas block their path, lounging and chewing on bones.
Timon	Hyenas. I hate hyenas. [whispering] So what's your plan for getting past those guys?
Simba	[whispering] Live bait.
Timon	[whispering] Good idea. [in his normal voice] Hey!
Simba	[whispering] Come on, Timon. You guys have to create a diversion.
Timon	What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?  ♪ [Loud drum beats startle the hyenas, who look up abruptly. Timon dances in a hula costume.] Luau! [Pumbaa sits nearby with an apple in his mouth.] If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, [Timon darts onto Pumbaa's back.] eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat.

Hyenas	*snarl*
The scene transitions. Simba and Nala slink closer to Pride Rock. They pause.
Simba	Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses. [Nala nods.] I'll look for Scar.
Simba and Nala part ways. Simba creeps closer to Pride Rock. Thunder rumbles overhead. Scar stands atop a boulder near Pride Rock.
Scar	Sarabi!
Scar's voice echoes. Simba peers out from behind a rock.
Simba	*gasps*
Sarabi strides through the crowd of hyenas who are gathered below Pride Rock. They growl and snap at her heels, but she does not flinch. Simba watches sadly. Sarabi climbs up to stand in front of Scar.
Sarabi	Yes, Scar?
Scar	Where is your hunting party? [Scar paces back and forth in front of Sarabi.] They're not doing their job.
Sarabi	Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.
Scar	[angrily] No! You're just not looking hard enough.
Scar strides away.
Sarabi	It's over. There is nothing left. We have only one choice. [emphatically] We must leave Pride Rock.
Scar turns back to face Sarabi.
Scar	We're not going anywhere.
Sarabi	Then you have sentenced us to death!
Scar	Then so be it.
Sarabi	[incredulous] You can't do that.
Scar	I am the king. [Scar sits, holding his head high.] I can do whatever I want.
Sarabi	If you were half the king Mufasa was, you would nev...
Scar flips around and backhands Sarabi. She falls.
Scar	I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!
Simba emerges on a high ledge. Thunder booms, and lightning crashes.
Simba	*roars*
Scar stares in fear as Simba descends the ledge.
Scar	Mufasa? No, [Scar backs away.] you're dead.
Simba approaches Sarabi and nudges her gently.
Sarabi	*groans* [Sarabi stares up at Simba.] Mufasa?
Simba	No. It's me.
Sarabi's eyes widen.
Sarabi	Simba! [Sarabi smiles.] You're alive? How can that be?
Simba	It doesn't matter. [Simba bends down and nuzzles Sarabi.] I'm home.
Scar watches Sarabi and Simba in confusion.
Scar	Simba? [coyly] Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you... [Scar's voice drops, and he looks up pointedly.] alive.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed stand on a ledge above Scar.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*gulp*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed back out of sight. Simba advances on Scar, furious.
Simba	Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Scar backs away.
Scar	Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Scar stops, cornered against Pride Rock.
Simba	Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Scar	[through nervous laughter] Oh, ye... Well, I would, naturally. However, there is one little problem. You see them? [Scar points up to where legions of hyenas snarl down at Simba.] They think [Scar gestures to himself.] I'm king.
Nala	[from offscreen] Well, we don't. [Scar and Simba look at Nala, who stands surrounded by lionesses. Two help Sarabi stand.] Simba's the rightful king.
Simba	The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight.
Scar strides past Simba.
Scar	Oh, must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. [Scar looks over one shoulder at Simba.] Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
Simba	That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me.
Scar strides toward the lionesses.
Scar	But what about your faithful subjects? Have they put it behind them?
Scar grins at the lionesses. Sarabi stares back stonily, while Nala looks troubled.
Nala	Simba, what is he talking about?
Scar circles Simba.
Scar	Ah, so you haven't told them your little secret. Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. [Scar paces past the lionesses.] Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.
Nala and Sarabi look expectantly at Simba, who steps forward.
Simba	I am.
Nala and Sarabi stare at Simba in horror. Sarabi approaches Simba.
Sarabi	[heartbroken] It's not true. Tell me it's not true.
Simba	It's true.
Scar	You see? He admits it? [Lightning flashes behind Scar. Thunder booms.] Murderer!
Simba	No, it was an accident!
Scar circles Simba rapidly.
Scar	If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?
Simba	No.
Scar	Then you're guilty.
Simba	[with wide eyes] No, I'm not a murderer!
Scar backs Simba toward the promontory of Pride Rock, with hyenas fanned out behind him.
Scar	Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again. But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you. And now everyone knows why!
Scar lunges at Simba, who slips and barely catches on to the ledge.
Nala	Simba!
Lightning strikes the foliage below Pride Rock, setting it ablaze. Simba dangles from the promontory, while Scar looms over him.
Scar	Now, this looks familiar. [Scar holds a claw to his face in mock contemplation.] Hmm. [Simba struggles to hold on, hanging only by his paws.] Where have I seen this before? Let me think. Hmm. [in mock realization] Oh, yes! I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died. [Simba nearly loses his grip. Scar sinks his claws into Simba's paws.] And here's my little secret. [Scar leans in close to whisper in Simba's ear.] I killed Mufasa.
Simba's eyes widen. A flashback starts. Mufasa falls to his death. Young Simba stares in horror from atop the gorge.
Simba	No! [Young Simba's voice warps into adult Simba's voice. The flashback ends. Simba leaps up Pride Rock and pins Scar.] Murderer!
The lionesses stare in alarm.
Scar	No, Simba, please.
Simba	Tell them the truth.
Scar	Truth? But truth is in the eye of the beho... [Simba presses a paw to Scar's throat, choking him. Scar speaks in a croak.] All right. All right! [whispering] I did it.
Simba	So they can hear you.
Scar	[in a louder voice] I killed Mufasa!
The lionesses lunge into battle. The hyenas swarm Simba, knocking him off Scar. The lionesses attack the hyenas from behind. Simba fights off the hyenas from the ground, while Nala swats one away with her paw. Timon and Pumbaa charge into the fray.
Timon and Pumbaa	Hee-yah!
Timon and Pumbaa charge through the hyenas, with a bowling pins sound effect.
Timon	Excuse me! Pardon me! Comin' through! Hot stuff! [Timon hops off Pumbaa.] Whoo!
Pumbaa kicks away a hyena. Timon and Pumbaa look left and right, braced for action.
Timon and Pumbaa	*grunt*
Timon and Pumbaa charge off. Simba runs away from a hyena, who nips him from behind. Several hyenas attack him, including one who jumps on him from a high ledge and begins biting his mane.
Simba	*roars*
A stick hits the hyena on the head, knocking it away. Simba looks up questioningly. Rafiki, standing on a high ledge, shakes his staff over his head.
Rafiki	*screeches*
Rafiki jumps down in the middle of several hyenas, hefting his staff over his head like it's a sword. The hyenas charge at Rafiki one by one.
Hyenas	*snarl*
Rafiki kicks several hyenas away.
Rafiki	*ninja noises* [Rafiki beats back two hyenas with his staff. One attempts to attack him from behind, but, without turning around, Rafiki punches it in the face.] Yow!
The battle continues, with the lionesses fighting the hyenas atop Pride Rock while a fire rages on in the background. Many hyenas flee out of sight. The scene transitions. Banzai chases Timon.
Timon	*pants* [Banzai snaps at Timon's heels. Timon jumps into the air.] Ah! *whimpers*
Banzai chases Timon into Pride Rock.
Zazu	[from within his bone cage] Let me out! Let me out!
Timon clambers into the cage next to Zazu.
Timon	Let me in! Let me in!
Shenzi and Banzai surround the cage, licking their chops.
Shenzi and Banzai	*cackle*
Timon clings to Zazu. He lets go and clasps his hands pleadingly.
Timon	Please, don't eat me.
Pumbaa	[from offscreen] Drop 'em!
Shenzi and Banzai look up in surprise. Pumbaa stands in the entrance of the cave, clearly disgruntled.
Banzai	Hey! Who's the pig?
Pumbaa	Are you talkin' to me?
Timon	Uh-oh. They called him a pig.
Pumbaa	Are you talking to me?
Timon	Shouldn't have done that.
Pumbaa	[shouting] Are you talking to me?!
Timon	Now, they're in for it.
Pumbaa	They call me Mr. Pig. [Pumbaa charges at Shenzi and Banzai.] Aaah!
Ed stands outside Pride Rock. The ground shakes, with rocks falling around him.
Zazu	[from offscreen] Take that, you stupid...
Banzai	[from offscreen] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Timon	[from offscreen] Take that and that!
Pumbaa	[from offscreen] Keep at 'em! Keep at 'em!
Timon	[from offscreen] Ow! Ooh! Whoo, baby!
Shenzi and Banzai flee the cave, running into Ed.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*yip*
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed charge off.
Timon	[from offscreen] Whoo!
Timon, Pumbaa, and Zazu emerge from the cave.
Pumbaa	Run, ya yellow-belly!
Timon, Pumbaa, and Zazu	[chanting] Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
The scene transitions. Simba runs along the edge of Pride Rock. He spots Scar slinking away. Scar pauses, looking back at Simba. There is a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning. Simba chases after Scar, who flees up Pride Rock.
Simba	*snarls* [Scar leaps over flames. He runs to the peak of Pride Rock and skids to a stop at the edge, sending rocks pattering to the ground below. He looks over one shoulder. Simba leaps over the flames to join him at the top of Pride Rock.] *roars* [Simba stalks slowly toward Scar.] *growls* Murderer.
Scar	Simba, Simba, please. [Scar crouches.] Please, have mercy. I beg you.
Simba	You don't deserve to live.
Scar	[hyperventilating] But, Simba, I am [Scar crouches lower and smiles shakily.] family. [Scar stands up straight.] It's the hyenas who are the real enemy. [Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed listen to Scar's betrayal from behind the flames.] It was their fault. It was their idea.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed back away.
Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed	*growl*
Simba stalks closer to Scar.
Simba	Why should I believe you? [Scar crouches lower as Simba gets closer.] Everything you ever told me was a lie.
Simba looms over Scar.
Scar	What are you going to do? [Scar grins.] You wouldn't kill your own uncle...
Simba	[glowering] No, Scar. I'm not like you.
Scar	Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble. I'll make it up to you, I promise. [Scar stands.] And, uh, how can I prove myself to you? [Scar gestures definitively.] Tell me, I mean, anything.
Simba	Run. [Scar's face falls.] Run away, Scar. And never return.
Scar	[haltingly] Yes. [Scar slinks past Simba, who glares at him.] Of course. As you wish, [Scar eyes some burning embers at his paws.] Your Majesty!
Scar flings the embers into Simba's eyes. Simba recoils.
Simba	*screams* [Simba paws at his face.] *groans*
Scar leaps on Simba.
Scar	*roars*
Scar and Simba wrestle on the ground.
Scar and Simba	*roar* [Scar pins Simba at the edge of Pride Rock. Simba bats him away.] *roar*
In slow motion, Scar and Simba lunge at each other, battering with their paws. Scar strikes Simba in the shoulder.
Simba	*roars*
Simba hits Scar in the face.
Scar	*growls*
Scar hits Simba in the face.
Simba	*roars*
The slow motion stops as Scar hits Simba again, this time knocking him to the ground. Simba looks up. In slow motion, Scar leaps toward Simba.
Scar	*roars*
The slow motion stops as Simba uses Scar's momentum to kick him away and send him flying off Pride Rock.
Simba	*roars*
Scar tumbles down Pride Rock and lands in a heap. Simba looks over the edge. Scar weakly sits up. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed emerge through the flames.
Scar	*pants* Ah, my friends!
Scar stands.
Shenzi	[through half-laughter] Friends? [to Banzai] I thought he said we were the enemy.
Banzai grins at Shenzi.
Banzai	Yeah. [Scar's eyes widen in fear.] That's what I heard.
Shenzi and Banzai look at Ed.
Shenzi and Banzai	Ed?
Ed	*laughs deviously*
Ed licks his chops. More hyenas surround and close in on Scar.
Hyenas	*cackle*
Scar backs toward Pride Rock.
Scar	No. Let... No. L-L-Let me explain. No, you don't understand! No, I didn't mean... [Scar flinches away from the advancing hyenas.] No! No! Look, I'm sorry I called you... No! No!
The shadows of the hyenas pounce on Scar. Flames rise around Pride Rock. Rain begins to fall, extinguishing the fire. Timon and Pumbaa emerge through the smoke. Simba descends Pride Rock. Zazu stands on a nearby rock and, as Simba passes, bows. A lioness rubs against Simba. Simba exchanges nuzzles with Sarabi, then Nala. There is a clatter of gourds, which makes Simba, Nala, and Sarabi look up. Rafiki stands near Pride Rock. He gestures to the promontory. Simba approaches Rafiki, who bows. Simba draws Rafiki into a hug, and, after a moment, Rafiki returns it. He then grips Simba by the shoulders.
Rafiki	It is time.
Simba walks toward the promontory of Pride Rock. Sarabi and Nala watch from below. Simba begins to ascend the promontory. Zazu watches in awe. Timon and Pumbaa do likewise. The rain washes away an animal skull. As Simba reaches the edge of the promontory, he stops and looks up at the stars. The clouds part.
Mufasa	[from offscreen] Remember.
Simba's expression changes to confidence. He musters himself.
